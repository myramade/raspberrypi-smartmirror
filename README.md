# Raspberry Pi Smart Mirror Project #
My first project of 2022 was Raspberry Pi Smart Mirror. I shared videos of the steps and my progress on TikTok. In this repo, I'll be sharing the all the resources I used for the project. 
I actually created three different versions, because I wanted to compare level of customizations and diffculty (Level 300 hard, 200 medium, 100 easy)

1. From scratch - putting all the partss together (Level 300)
2. Using a Magic Mirror from Vilros (Level 200)
